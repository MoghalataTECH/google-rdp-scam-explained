# Free Google RDP – Myth & Risk Demonstration (Educational)

⚠️ **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY – NO REAL RDP IS CREATED**

This repository demonstrates how so-called **“Free Google RDP for Life”**
Bash scripts work, **why they are misleading**, and **how they put beginners at risk**.

❌ This project does NOT:
- Create a real Google RDP
- Install Chrome Remote Desktop
- Create system users
- Execute external commands
- Require a Google account

✅ This project DOES:
- Explain step-by-step what scam RDP scripts *claim* to do
- Show where security risks occur
- Teach beginners how to audit Bash scripts safely
- Demonstrate social-engineering techniques used in fake RDP repos

## 📌 Why This Exists

Hundreds of GitHub repositories claim to offer:
- “Free Google RDP”
- “Unlimited RDP”
- “RDP for life”

In reality:
- These scripts violate platform policies
- They create insecure admin users
- They trick users into pasting dangerous commands
- They often give attackers remote access

This repository **teaches awareness**, not exploitation.
